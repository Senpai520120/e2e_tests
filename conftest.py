"""Fixtures: what a test needs before it starts, and the cleanup after it.

pytest finds this file by itself. A test asks for a fixture just by naming it
as an argument:

    def test_something(admin_page):   # pytest runs the admin_page fixture first
        ...

`page` and `new_context` come from the pytest-playwright plugin:
    page         a fresh browser tab, nobody signed in
    new_context  makes one more separate browser (own cookies, own session)

A fixture with `yield` works in two halves: the code before `yield` prepares,
the test runs, then the code after `yield` cleans up, even if the test failed.
